#Ella's WDI06 Project 2: Turnip the Beet

Turnip the Beet is my app to help Seattle gardeners discover vegetable plants and learn about how to grow them. 

This app uses the following technologies:
* javascript 
* html/css
* Materialize (a front-end responsive framework) 
* jQuery
* ajax 
* Express
* Postgres database 
* sequelize 
* cloudinary

I started this project with an idea about making a gardening guide and some wireframes. First I structured the database tables, then worked out the various routes within the app. I hope to add more content and data to this app, and to refine the functionality so that it is even more useful.
